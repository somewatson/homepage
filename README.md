### Notes
* Code-server has 3 methods for accessing web services, such as the HTTP server that runs in preview mode. 
    * The first is subdomain, the next is subpath, and the final is using your own proxy. 
    * Source: https://coder.com/docs/code-server/guide#using-a-subpath
    * We ended up using the subpath method
* Rano and Sportsliker mentioned, try importing tailwind through the css file for intellisense to work properly
    * Right now, it's imported inside of the HTML from the CDN
